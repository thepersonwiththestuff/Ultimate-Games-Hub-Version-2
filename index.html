                    <li>Not much to say this week, there were suggestions for making a minecraft server and connecting it to the site. If anyone knows how to set up an eaglercraft server or can find out information on it, I could potentially do such a thing, so maybe keep an eye out for that</li>
                    <li>Fun Fact of the Week: People use the site most on Tuesday for some reason (not even a joke, DDAM)</li>
